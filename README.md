# Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my technical skills, workflow and commitment to industry best practices.

The site is designed and developed using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, with a mobile first approach, and a focus on sustainable and scalable code.

This project is actively evolving as I continue learning new technologies and refining my work. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
